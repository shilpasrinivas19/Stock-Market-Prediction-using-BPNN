# Stock-Market-Prediction-using-BPNN
Due to extremely volatile nature of financial markets, it is commonly 
accepted the stock price prediction is a task full of challenge. However in order to 
make profits or understand the essence of equity market, numerous market 
participants or researchers try to forecast stock price using various statistical or 
neural network models. In this work, we survey the predictive power of neural 
network models. Accurate financial predictions are challenging and attractive to 
individual investors and corporations.
The rise of Neural Network models has laid the path in solving a lot of 
problems in wide research areas, especially Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) have 
achieved significant success in the area of Forecasting by providing efficient 
solutions through different architectures.
Our aim to propose a gradient based back propagation neural network 
approach to improve optimization in stock price predictions. The use of gradient 
descent in BPNN method aims to determine the parameter of learning rate, training 
Cycle adaptively so as to get best value in process of stock data training in order to 
obtain accuracy in prediction. To test Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) 
method, Mean square error (MSE) is used to prediction result and data reality. The 
smallest MSE value shows better results compared to larger MSE value in 
prediction
